s observed that as I increase the number of digits beyong 0.000 i.e. 0.0001.. there is always a loss when I transmit the data via serial communication, what can be done? 
1. use Mav link, to encrypt and decrypt the data
2. reduce the bandwidth and check what happens
3. (~(1 == 1)) is not the same as !(1==1)
4. difference between double i = 1/2; and double i = 1.0/2.0;
